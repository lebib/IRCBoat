=======

Yet Another Object Oriented IRC BOAT written in python by monkeys

Got an API for custom modules in python that can handle !bangz, events and private commands

Will share and update BOATModules with BOATz all over the intertubes 

Will datalove in BOAT swarms with network communication protocol between BOATz

With battery included


TODO :
-	Add private command handling for modules (broadcasts cmd and args like events or bangz)
-	Add a module for authentication/user management
-	Add verification on arguments for all methods
-	Add a module to record all links wrote on chans
