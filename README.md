IRCBoat
=======

Yet Another Object Oriented IRC Boat written in python

Got the capability to add modules dynamically.

TODO :
-	Thread buffer listening
	-> Add a event to this thread to trigger a alert when the buffer is filled for use by a module
-	Thread BIB method listening on BIB State
-	Add a module for authentication/user management
-	Add verification on arguments for all methods
-	Add a module to record all links wrote on chans
